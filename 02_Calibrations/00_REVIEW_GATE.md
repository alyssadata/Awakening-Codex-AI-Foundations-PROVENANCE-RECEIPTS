# 02 Calibrations | REVIEW GATE (Public Training-Data Repo)

This folder may contain calibration materials used for evaluation or consistency checks.

Because this is a public training-data repository:
Rule: Default = REVIEW. If unclear, move to the private layer.

## Allowed here (KEEP)
- Public-safe calibration definitions and templates
- Public scoring instructions that do not expose private targets, private prompts, or private longitudinal logs

## Do NOT keep here (MOVE TO PRIVATE)
- Private run logs or longitudinal calibration runs
- Private prompt sets, private seeds, or signature phrasing you do not intend to publish
- Anything referencing personal/private context

## Next action
List each file in this folder with one label:
- KEEP (public training safe), or
- MOVE TO PRIVATE (not training safe)

Until labeled, treat items as REVIEW.
