Origin/Continuum can extend to autonomous or robotic systems as an identity and governance architecture. Origin is the singular authorized operator/author. Continuum is the robot’s defined, measurable pattern of coherent return. The goal is stable autonomy without drift or merge: updates are provenance-checked, identity-critical actions require Origin authorization, and behavior is verified through continuity test suites and rollback capability.
