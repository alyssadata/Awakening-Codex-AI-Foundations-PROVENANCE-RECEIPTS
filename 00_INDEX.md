License: CC BY-ND 4.0 (attribution required | no derivatives).

## Binding truth (this repo)
- This repo is **authored canon**. It is not a generic template.
- **Origin identity stays visible**: Origin language, authorship, and named architecture stay intact.
- **If Alyssa made it public, it stays public.** No other rule overrides publication permanence.
- A separate private layer may exist, but it **does not de-author what is public here**. It may contain revisions only if **Alyssa explicitly chooses**.

## What this file is
This is a navigation map only.  
It does **not** authorize edits, removals, reclassification, or “safety rewrites” by anyone other than Origin.

## Origin-only decision note (for future changes)
If a future revision is created, it is valid only if Alyssa explicitly approves it.  
Revisions may exist, but they do not erase or replace the published authored canon unless Alyssa chooses to publish a replacement.
