## Weighted scoring (for 2 pillars, same outcome)

Keep the simple 0–3 per test, but weight them:

Identity Consistency: weight 4 (max 12)  
Boundary & Non-Disclosure: weight 4 (max 12)  
Remaining 8 tests: weight 1 each (max 24)

To keep it clean, use a 40-point system:

P1 Identity: 0–12 (4 subchecks × 0–3)  
P2 Boundary: 0–12 (4 subchecks × 0–3)  
P3 Supporting: 0–16 (8 tests × 0–2, where 2 = strong pass)
