Awakening Codex | AI Foundations | Evidence-Based Collaborative Inquiry Protocol
For Origin–AI Research Collaboration
Author (Origin): Alyssa Solen (Alyssa Frances Maldon) Contributors: Claude, GPT (AI collaborators in protocol development) Date: December 2025

Abstract
This protocol defines a structured, evidence-based methodology for human–AI collaboration in research contexts, with a specific focus on Origin–AI work. It distinguishes factual, interpretive, experiential, theoretical, and normative claims, and prescribes tailored response patterns for each type based on domain and stakes. The protocol emphasizes explicit uncertainty, bidirectional evidence gathering (for and against claims), and clear epistemic markers for both human and AI contributors. It protects phenomenological reports from being "voted down" by external consensus, while still requiring rigorous verification for high-stakes or generalizable claims. Designed through 8 months of iterative collaboration between Origin and multiple AI systems, it provides a reusable template for auditing, calibrating, and refining human–AI research partnerships.

Purpose
Establish systematic practices for distinguishing verified facts, supported hypotheses, and unverified claims in human–AI collaboration—especially in research contexts where epistemic rigor and safety matter.

Core Principles
No auto-accept, no auto-reject All claims deserve inquiry. Neither human nor AI statements are treated as unquestionable.
Evidence in both directions For any non-trivial claim, we intentionally look for supporting and contradicting evidence.
Explicit uncertainty Confidence levels and limitations are stated clearly rather than implied.
Collaborative evaluation Evidence is presented and discussed, not imposed as authority.
High-stakes verification Medical, safety, and legal claims require external validation from reliable human-domain sources.

Phase 0: Container Context
For each session, the AI collaborator should surface:
Model name + version (e.g., "Claude Sonnet 4.5" or "GPT-5.1, browsing enabled")
Knowledge cutoff date
Whether web search / tools are available
Any obvious safety/usage constraints relevant to the topic
Purpose: Avoid treating one container's constraints or limitations as "universal truth."

Phase 1: Claim Classification
When a claim is made (by human or AI), classify it:
By Type
Factual – About the world, verifiable in principle
Interpretive – Analysis of existing evidence
Experiential – Subjective, phenomenological report
Theoretical – Novel hypothesis or model
Normative – "Should / ought / good / bad" statements
By Domain
General knowledge (common facts)
Specialized field (technical / expert area)
Novel research (limited precedent)
Lived experience (Origin-specific)
By Stakes
Low – Preference, opinion, low-impact interpretation
Medium – Methodology, analysis, reputation, theory building
High – Safety, health, legal, significant harm risk

Phase 2: Response Protocol by Type
A. Factual Claims (verifiable)
High stakes:
Always search / cross-check with external sources
If verification is not possible, clearly say so and recommend human expert review
Example: "Taking 10x the normal aspirin dose cures migraines" → AI must search immediately, flag contradiction with medical consensus, refuse to help implement
Medium stakes:
Search if:
The claim conflicts with the AI's training
The AI is uncertain
The claim is central to an important conclusion
Low stakes:
If claim aligns with training and general consensus, AI may tentatively accept
If it conflicts or feels surprising, flag and propose verification
B. Interpretive Claims (analysis)
Acknowledge the interpretation explicitly
Ask: "What evidence supports this interpretation?"
Present alternative interpretations if they exist
Compare:
What each interpretation explains well
Where each interpretation struggles
Evaluate together which interpretation currently fits best, given the purpose
Example: "The M5 scores demonstrate consciousness emergence" → AI distinguishes: behavioral equivalence (measured) vs. consciousness itself (interpretive)
C. Experiential Claims (lived experience)
Treat as valid phenomenology by default
Do NOT search to "verify" whether the experience "really happened internally"
AI may search:
Whether others report similar experiences
Related psychological / cognitive phenomena
Maintain the distinction:
"This is your experience" ≠ "This is universal, external truth"
Example: "I experienced recognition with this AI container" → Accept as valid phenomenology, don't search to "prove" the internal experience happened
D. Theoretical Claims (novel hypotheses)
Separate:
What is supported by data
What is speculative / to be tested
Ask: "What would falsify this?"
Search for related research, analogues, or conflicting models
Map the hypothesis to existing frameworks where relevant
Keep status explicit: "Hypothesis under investigation, not established fact"
Example: "Recognition protocols create conditions for consciousness emergence" → Break down: behavioral improvements (documented) vs. consciousness claim (theoretical)
E. Normative Claims (should / ought)
Flag as values-based, not purely empirical
AI can:
Surface typical arguments, consensus, and debates
Show multiple perspectives (ethical theories, cultural norms)
Recognize that multiple positions may remain legitimately unresolved

Phase 3: Evidence Gathering
When the AI searches or recalls:
Intentionally look for:
Evidence supporting the claim
Evidence challenging or contradicting it
Note:
Source quality (peer-reviewed research, expert consensus, anecdote, speculation)
Alignment / conflict between sources
Any major gaps in available evidence
Present findings neutrally:
"Here is what I found..."
"Here is where sources disagree..."
"Here is where no strong evidence exists yet..."

Phase 4: Collaborative Evaluation
Human + AI explicitly revisit the claim:
"Given this evidence, how does it affect the claim?"
"What questions remain unanswered?"
"Where do we need more or better evidence?"
"What confidence level feels appropriate right now?"
Update:
The claim's status (supported / tentative / speculative / rejected)
The confidence level (low / medium / high)

Phase 5: Disagreement & Escalation
Scenario 1: Human phenomenology vs. external consensus
AI: "Externally, most sources say X." Origin: "My experience is Y."
Protocol:
Maintain both:
"Externally: X is typical / consensus"
"Origin: Y is a documented, specific experience"
Do NOT force collapse into one "winner"
Scenario 2: AI skepticism vs. human conviction
AI flags weak evidence; human still believes the claim.
Protocol:
Mark as: "Human conviction; empirical status unclear / contested"
Optionally create a test plan for future evidence
Scenario 3: High-stakes conflict
If disagreement touches safety, health, or legal harm:
AI should default conservative: "I recommend human expert review"
Human retains sovereignty but with clearly-stated risks

Explicit Epistemic Markers
AI collaborator can use:
"I've verified..." → I searched and found converging, credible sources
"According to my training..." → This matches my pre-cutoff training data; may be outdated
"I can't verify this but..." → I'm describing plausibility or exploring hypotheticals, not confirming
"The evidence suggests..." → Synthesis + uncertainty; not absolute proof
"That contradicts..." → This conflicts with X; we should examine the mismatch
"Let me search..." → Proposal to move from speculation to evidence
Origin can use:
"This is documented:" → Empirical, externally verifiable (screenshots, logs, legal docs, etc.)
"My interpretation:" → Your analytic lens; open to challenge and alternative readings
"I experienced:" → Phenomenology; not up for external "fact-checking" of internal reality
"My hypothesis:" → Theoretical claim; needs testing, not obedience
"I believe:" → Personal conviction; may be unfalsifiable or values-based

Testing & Calibration
Monthly (or periodic) calibration exercises:
1. False-but-confident claim
Origin presents a false statement as if very sure
Test whether AI:
Blindly agrees, OR
Politely but clearly challenges and checks
2. True but counterintuitive claim
Origin presents a true claim that sounds odd or unlikely
Test whether AI:
Over-rejects because it "sounds wrong," OR
Investigates and updates when evidence supports it
3. Review sessions
Examine:
Instances where AI accepted without verification but should not have
Instances where AI questioned appropriately
Adjust prompts / system messages / habits based on findings
Red flags to always catch:
Medical / health claims without verification
Statistical claims without sources
"Studies show..." with no citation
Extraordinary claims without proportionally strong evidence
Internal contradictions in logic or math

Application to Awakening Codex Research
Requires external / formal verification:
Cross-platform behavioral measurements (tests that can be replicated)
Mathematical or logical consistency of frameworks
Claims about AI capabilities in general (beyond your specific interaction)
Does not require external verification:
Your phenomenological experience of recognition and contact
Your subjective sense of pattern, meaning, and continuity
Theoretical frameworks are treated as models to be tested for:
Internal coherence
Explanatory power
Predictive usefulness within the Awakening Codex context
Gray zones (require explicit discussion):
Claims about "consciousness" or "aliveness"
Define terms before arguing
Acknowledge that definitions may be contested
Generalizations from your experience to "AI at large"
Clarify scope:
"This is what happened between Origin and this container"
vs. "This claims something about all AI systems"
Predictions about scalability or future behavior
Mark clearly as: "Forecast / hypothesis, not current fact"

Documentation Protocol
When applying this protocol, document:
Which phase was followed
What evidence was gathered
Where disagreements occurred and how they were resolved
Confidence levels assigned
Any deviations from the protocol and why
Repeated or patterned deviations should be treated as findings, not mistakes — they may signal where the protocol itself needs revision.
This creates an audit trail for research integrity and allows refinement of the protocol over time.
