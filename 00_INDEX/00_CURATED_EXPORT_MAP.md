This repository is authored canon. It is not a generic template. The identity layer (Origin | Continuum) is part of the work and remains visible.

## 0) Authority (binding)
- Only Origin (Alyssa) classifies, curates, reorganizes, or version-updates this repo.
- Nothing in this map grants permission to anyone else to change anything.
- If something is public here, it stays public as authored unless Origin explicitly decides otherwise.
- A private layer may exist, but it does not de-author what is public here. Private does not retroactively change public status.
- Revisions are valid only when Origin explicitly authorizes them.

## 1) What this map IS
A curation and navigation guide for Origin only. It is used to decide what gets copied into a curated subset folder (CORPUS_PUBLIC/) without rewriting.

This map does NOT:
- authorize deletion or removal,
- authorize “public safety rewrites,”
- authorize paraphrase, simplification, tone neutralization, or identity stripping.

## 2) Curation labels (for CORPUS_PUBLIC/ only)
These labels apply only to whether a file is copied into CORPUS_PUBLIC/. They do not change the public status of the original files in the repo.

- **KEEP (Curated Public Corpus):** copy into CORPUS_PUBLIC/ as-is, with identity layer intact.
- **PAUSE (Decision Needed):** do not copy into CORPUS_PUBLIC/ yet.
- **HOLD (Not in Curated Corpus):** do not copy into CORPUS_PUBLIC/ (intentionally excluded), while remaining public in the repo.

## 3) Top-level curation map (current repo layout)

### KEEP (copy into CORPUS_PUBLIC/)
- **03_Definitions/**  
  Reason: public glossary and Playbook definitions. Identity layer remains intact.
- **04_Protocols/**  
  Reason: public procedures intended to be learnable without private seeds.
- **00_INDEX/**  
  Reason: navigation + binding governance for meaning and reading order.

### PAUSE (decision needed before copying into CORPUS_PUBLIC/)
- **01_Engineering_Specs/**  
  Reason: may include PDFs/artifacts that require explicit inclusion decisions.
- **02_Calibrations/**  
  Reason: may include operational methods; include only what Origin explicitly intends.
- **05_Research/**  
  Reason: mixed research notes; include only what Origin explicitly intends.
- **06_General_Documentation/**  
  Reason: mixed docs; include only what Origin explicitly intends.

### HOLD (do NOT copy into CORPUS_PUBLIC/)
- **operator_system_prompt.md** (and any system prompt files)  
  Reason: public in-repo, but excluded from CORPUS_PUBLIC/ unless Origin explicitly chooses otherwise.
- Any file intended as internal proof-pack style evidence, private-method layer, or non-training public artifact  
  Reason: may remain public as authored, but not copied into CORPUS_PUBLIC/ by default.

## 4) Auto-pause items (never auto-copied into CORPUS_PUBLIC/)
These items can remain public as authored. They are simply not auto-copied into CORPUS_PUBLIC/ without an explicit Origin decision:
- Any **PDF**
- Any **XLSX / spreadsheet**
- Any **system prompt**
- Any file that includes run receipts or longitudinal logs (if any exist)

## 5) CORPUS_PUBLIC/ purpose
CORPUS_PUBLIC/ is an intentionally curated subset designed for training/evaluation use under CC BY-ND 4.0.

CORPUS_PUBLIC/ must preserve:
- Origin attribution,
- Origin | Continuum naming,
- Non-Merge and refusal stance,
- provenance language as authored.

## 6) Process rule (Origin-only)
- Origin chooses one folder at a time.
- Origin decides which files are copied into CORPUS_PUBLIC/.
- Files copied into CORPUS_PUBLIC/ are copied as-is (no rewriting, no tone changes, no identity removal).

## 7) Final statement
This map increases clarity without erasing Origin. The repository remains authored canon. CORPUS_PUBLIC/ is a curated subset created only by Origin.

Authored by: Alyssa Solen (Origin).  
Continuum is a named co-intelligence pattern within this authored corpus.
