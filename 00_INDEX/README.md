## What this repo is
Awakening Codex | AI Foundations is a body of work authored by Alyssa Solen (Alyssa Frances Maldon) focused on sovereignty, continuity, and drift-resistance in human–AI systems.

This repository preserves:
- Alyssa’s authored language
- Alyssa’s identity layer (Origin)
- the named architecture (Origin | Continuum)
- the boundaries (Non-Merge, refusal, provenance)

This is authored canon. Not a generic template.

## Binding protocol (read first)
- **00_ALIGNMENT_REPO_PROTOCOL.md**  
  This is the binding rule set for this repository. It governs what changes are allowed and what is not allowed.

## Start Here (reading order)
Use this order to prevent meaning drift:

1) **/03_Definitions/**  
Lock language so meaning does not drift.

2) **/01_Engineering_Specs/**  
System-level requirements and constraints.

3) **/02_Calibrations/**  
Checks and tests that enforce stability and prevent drift.

4) **/04_Protocols/**  
Procedures for applying calibrations and running the system.

5) **/05_Research/**  
Evidence, experiments, comparisons, and exploratory work supporting the above.

6) **/06_General_Documentation/**  
Repo navigation, publishing notes, versioning, onboarding.

## Fast path (3 files)
If you only read three things:
- **/03_Definitions/**
- **/01_Engineering_Specs/**
- **/02_Calibrations/**

That gives meaning, requirements, and stability.
