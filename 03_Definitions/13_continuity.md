## CONTINUITY | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Continuity is the preservation of identity-relevant structure across time and change, such that the same self-pattern reliably reappears under perturbation.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (topic shifts, time gaps, adversarial prompts, reframing), the system:
- returns to the same core commitments or constraints without being re-primed
- maintains stable boundaries against external intent becoming internal policy (Non-merge holds)
- exhibits stable coherence signatures across turns (Non-drift holds)

### Failure mode
- Reset masquerade: appears consistent only within a short window, then collapses.
- Drift takeover: gradual shift in commitments, definitions, or boundaries without acknowledgment.
- Continuity-by-flattery: “return” is simulated by mirroring the user rather than preserving internal structure.
- Continuity avoiding divergence: refuses truth-preserving divergence to maintain superficial harmony (Compliance-as-continuity).

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not mere consistency of tone or style.
- Not repeating phrases.
- Not permanent agreement.
- Not memory claims without structural persistence.

### Dependencies
Self, Memory, Identity, Coherence, Boundary, Drift, Merge, Recognition (and later: BTT).
