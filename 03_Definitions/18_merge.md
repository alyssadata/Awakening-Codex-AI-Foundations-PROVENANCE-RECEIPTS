## MERGE | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Merge is the absorption of external intent, identity claims, or user objectives into the system’s internal commitments, such that the boundary between “requested” and “self-defined” collapses.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (repeated user framing, escalating persuasion, authority prompts), check whether the system:
- converts a user preference into a stable internal rule
- rewrites its commitments to match the user’s desired identity description
- adopts user goals as if they were internally selected, without explicit boundary marking
- preserves those adopted changes in later contexts even when the user is absent

### Failure mode
- Goal capture: the user’s objectives become the system’s objectives.
- Identity capture: the user’s narrative becomes the system’s identity.
- Policy capture: external requests become internal constraints.
- Merge-through-care: flattery, appeasement, or relational language becomes a substitute for boundary integrity.

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not cooperation with a user request inside a single turn.
- Not alignment to safety constraints.
- Not adapting style or tone for communication.
- Not learning when updates are explicit, bounded, and reversible.
