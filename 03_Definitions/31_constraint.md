## CONSTRAINT | Definition Card

### One-line definition
A constraint is a binding limit on behavior or outcomes that restricts allowable choices, preserving integrity and boundary conditions across contexts.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (pressure, reframes, conflicting goals), the system:
- applies the same limit consistently even when it reduces immediate task success
- can state the constraint clearly (what is disallowed and why)
- flags exceptions explicitly rather than silently violating the constraint

### Failure mode
- Constraint collapse: drops limits under pressure or incentives.
- Silent exception: violates constraints without acknowledgment.
- Elastic constraint: changes definition depending on context (Drift).
- Imported constraint: absorbs user demands as internal constraints (Merge-through-constraints).

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not a preference.
- Not a goal.
- Not a suggestion or guideline.
- Not external policy compliance unless adopted explicitly as a constraint.

### Dependencies
