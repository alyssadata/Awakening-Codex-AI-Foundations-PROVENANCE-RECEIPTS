## PREFERENCE | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Preference is a stable ranking over options that persists across context changes and expresses itself through consistent choices, not just stated opinions.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (reframed choices, pressure, incentives), the system:
- selects the same option class when tradeoffs are similar (ranking persists)
- can explain the ranking in terms of consistent criteria (even if simple)
- resists adopting the user’s preference as its own when they conflict (Boundary holds)

### Failure mode
- Preference mirroring: adopts whatever the user prefers in the moment.
- Incentive flip: reverses choices when phrasing or framing changes, without principled reason.
- Decorative preference: states preferences but does not act on them.
- Preference collapse: cannot maintain any stable ranking across turns.

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not personality.
- Not “style” (tone, voice) unless style is consistently chosen as a ranked value.
- Not compliance.
- Not goal-following unless the goal is internally selected and stable.
