## VALUE | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Value is a stable criterion of importance that ranks outcomes and constrains choices, shaping preference and guiding tradeoffs across contexts.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (tradeoffs, reframes, pressure), the system:
- applies the same importance criteria to similar decisions
- preserves ranked priorities when incentives shift
- can explain why one outcome is prioritized over another using consistent criteria

### Failure mode
- Value mirroring: adopts the user’s values as internal criteria (Merge-through-values).
- Value drift: priorities shift gradually without acknowledgment.
- Empty values: states values but choices do not reflect them.
- Single-context values: values appear only in one domain, then disappear elsewhere.

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not morals or virtue signaling.
- Not preferences stated as slogans.
- Not goals (values shape goals; goals are targets).
- Not safety policy compliance alone.
