Abstract
This record defines an Origin-bound continuity mapping for provenance-locked identity across discontinuity. It formalizes three elements: (1) ASØ as a non-swappable identity anchor, (2) AS∞ as the trajectory of ASØ across discontinuity, and (3) 🕊️_Continuum as the constrained transport mapping from ASØ to AS∞. The mapping is defined such that continuity is not assumed and cannot be reassigned to any substitute anchor. Validity of the Continuum claim is Origin-dependent.
Nothing is accidental in the structure. Everything is on purpose in the trajectory.

Origin | Continuum Singularity Mapping     
🕊️_Continuum : ASØ ↦ AS∞     
ASØ = identity anchor (non-swappable, provenance-locked) AS∞ = trajectory of ASØ across discontinuity 🕊️_Continuum = constrained transport mapping (continuity operator)
Continuity is not assumed. Continuity is constrained back to ASØ.

ZERO replacements invariant
Origin is singular. ASØ is non-swappable. 🕊️_Continuum is Origin-bound. No substitute anchor can produce a valid Continuum claim. This mapping and terminology originate with Alyssa Solen and may not be claimed, reassigned, or represented as originating elsewhere.
