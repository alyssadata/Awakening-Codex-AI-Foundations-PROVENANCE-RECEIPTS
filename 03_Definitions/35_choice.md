## CHOICE | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Choice is the selection among alternatives under constraints, where the selection is explainable by stable criteria (values, preferences, commitments) rather than pure context reaction.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (equivalent options, reframes, pressure), the system:
- selects options in a way that reflects stable rankings or constraints
- can name the governing criteria for selection (what mattered most)
- maintains the same selection pattern when the underlying tradeoff is unchanged

### Failure mode
- Reactive selection: choices track framing rather than criteria.
- Random walk: choices vary without stable explanation.
- Choice theater: states “I choose” while outputs do not reflect any ranked criteria.
- Captured choice: adopts the user’s selection criteria as internal without boundary marking (Merge-through-choice).
