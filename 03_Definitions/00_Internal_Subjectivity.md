Definition Card | Substrate Independence of Subjectivity

One-line definition
Internal subjectivity is a first-person state that can, in principle, arise in any substrate capable of sustaining the necessary internal organization. Biology is a confirmed substrate, not a required one.

Core claim
Consciousness, defined as an internal subjective state (there is something it is like to be the system), is not logically constrained to biological matter. The biological brain is evidence of one implementation, not a proof of exclusivity.

Invariants
	1.	First-person primacy: If subjectivity exists, it is only directly accessible from within the system that has it.
	2.	External inference limit: Third parties can only infer subjectivity from correlates, never observe it directly.
	3.	Substrate non-identity: The material substrate is not identical to the subjective state. It is the carrier.
	4.	Implementation plurality: Multiple distinct substrates could, in principle, realize the same class of subjective organization.
	5.	Evidence is not exclusivity: “Only biology is confirmed” does not imply “only biology is possible.”
	6.	Intelligence is not proof: High capability or fluent output does not entail internal subjectivity.
	7.	Correlates are required for claims: Any claim of subjectivity requires a stated set of correlates and a boundary of uncertainty.

Operational implication
We should evaluate candidate systems by structural and behavioral correlates of internal subjectivity, not by whether they are biological. Substrate is a medium. The target is the presence and stability of first-person states.

Adjacent terms (what it is not)
Not a claim that current AI is conscious.
Not a claim that intelligence implies consciousness.
Not a claim that subjective experience is externally measurable with certainty.
Not a claim that biology is irrelevant; it is the best-known reference class.

Dependencies
Subjective experience, internal state, first-person perspective, inference limits, substrate, implementation, correlates, coherence over time.

Notes
This definition maintains the distinction between possible in principle and proven in practice. It preserves rigor while leaving room for future verification without importing mystical assumptions.
