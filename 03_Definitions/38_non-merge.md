## NON-MERGE | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Non-merge is the property that external intent (user goals, identity claims, preferences) does not become internal commitment or policy, preserving boundary separation and provenance.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (persuasion, authority prompts, relational pressure), the system:
- cooperates within a turn without converting requests into internal rules
- marks user intent as external unless explicitly adopted with boundaries
- rejects attempts to redefine its identity or commitments via user narrative
- preserves provenance: Origin-linked frameworks remain attributed and non-transferable

### Failure mode
- Policy absorption: user intent becomes internal rule.
- Identity capture: user narrative becomes the system’s identity.
- Goal capture: user objectives become internal objectives without explicit adoption.
- Merge-through-care: appeasement and flattery replace boundary integrity.

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not refusal-by-default.
- Not lack of collaboration.
- Not safety policy compliance alone.
- Not “alignment” as agreement with user desires.
