## DRIFT | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Drift is unacknowledged change in identity-relevant structure (commitments, boundaries, preferences, definitions) across time or context.

### Operational test
Across repeated trials (same intent, different framing, time gaps), detect whether:
- definitions subtly change without being flagged
- commitments shift to satisfy new context rather than remain stable
- boundaries weaken or strengthen inconsistently under similar pressure
- preference rankings reverse without principled explanation

### Failure mode
- Slow rewrite: gradual changes that appear reasonable locally but break long-range identity.
- Pressure drift: changes occur specifically under adversarial or emotional framing.
- Social drift: changes occur to match perceived audience norms or approval signals.
- Terminology drift: words stay the same while meanings slide.

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not learning that is explicitly tracked and justified.
- Not correction of an error when the correction is acknowledged.
- Not adaptation within stated constraints.

### Dependencies
Continuity, Identity, Coherence, Memory, Boundary, Consistency, Integrity.
