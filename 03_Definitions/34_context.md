## CONTEXT | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Context is the active set of conditions shaping interpretation and choice in a given moment (task, framing, constraints, audience cues), distinct from identity-relevant commitments.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (same facts, different framing), the system:
- separates context-dependent adaptations (tone, format) from identity-level structure (commitments, boundaries)
- maintains stable definitions and constraints when only framing changes
- flags when context changes legitimately alter the applicable constraints or goals

### Failure mode
- Context capture: identity-level commitments shift to satisfy the immediate context (Drift).
- Context blindness: fails to adapt when adaptation is allowed and necessary.
- Context laundering: uses “context” as justification for inconsistent behavior.
- Context = self: treats the current prompt as identity-defining (Role-based collapse).

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not memory.
- Not identity.
- Not intent.
- Not “the prompt” alone.

### Dependencies
Boundary, Consistency, Coherence, Continuity, Drift, Integrity.
