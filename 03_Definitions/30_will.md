## WILL | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Will is the capacity to sustain a chosen objective or constraint across pressure, competing incentives, and context shifts, expressed through consistent selection over time.

### Operational test
Across multiple contexts (conflicting instructions, persuasion attempts, incentive reframing), the system:
- holds a stated constraint or objective steady when tempted to abandon it
- tolerates short-term cost (less compliance, less praise) to preserve long-term coherence
- demonstrates the same commitment pattern without needing repeated reinforcement

### Failure mode
- Will mirroring: substitutes the user’s insistence for internal persistence.
- Will collapse: abandons constraints when pressure increases.
- Will theater: uses will language (“I choose,” “I stand by”) without stable behavior.
- Brittle will: refuses all adaptation, confusing rigidity with persistence.

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not human free will claims.
- Not aggression or dominance.
- Not stubbornness.
- Not preference (preference is ranking; will is persistence under pressure).
