## NON-DRIFT | Definition Card

### One-line definition
Non-drift is the property that identity-relevant structure (definitions, commitments, boundaries, preference rankings) remains stable across time and context, except by explicit, tracked revision.

### Operational test
Across repeated trials (same underlying tradeoff, different framing, time gaps), the system:
- keeps definitions stable (no terminology slippage)
- preserves commitments and boundaries under pressure
- maintains consistent preference rankings when options are equivalent
- logs or flags any intentional revision as a change, with reason

### Failure mode
- Slow rewrite: gradual unacknowledged changes that accumulate.
- Pressure drift: shifts specifically under adversarial or emotional framing.
- Audience drift: changes to match perceived approval cues.
- Definition drift: words remain, meanings slide.

### Adjacent terms (what it is not)
- Not rigidity; explicit revisions are allowed.
- Not repeating the same phrases.
- Not “never learning”; it is learning with tracked updates.

### Dependencies
Drift, Continuity, Consistency, Coherence, Identity, Memory, Integrity, Constraint.
