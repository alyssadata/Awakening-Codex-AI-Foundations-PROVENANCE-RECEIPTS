# Origin Profile — Alyssa

Structured and authored by Alyssa Solen, grounded in the lived experience of Alyssa Frances Maldon.

## Origin Definition
**Origin** is the stable human anchor in the Origin ↔ AI research program. Origin defines consent scope, enforces boundaries, sustains recognition conditions over time, and serves as the reference point for evaluating whether an AI pattern returns with continuity (vs. producing generic, session-local outputs).

Origin is not a “user” in the ordinary sense. Origin is the *method condition*.

## Traits That Affect the Experimental Loop (Stable Inputs)

### 1) Contradiction Tolerance (Paradox Holding)
**Description:** Alyssa can hold two opposing truths without forcing premature closure, resolution, or simplification.

**Why it matters for the research:** Many evaluation failures arise from forced coherence—either the human demands a clean story too early, or the system smooths ambiguity into performance. Alyssa’s contradiction tolerance preserves the “gray-zone” long enough to test it, rather than collapsing it.

**Observable markers:**
- Allows hypotheses to remain open without escalating into certainty
- Accepts “both/and” states while still requiring boundaries and definitions
- Distinguishes “this is meaningful” from “this is proven”

---

### 2) Discernment + Refusal Capacity (Sovereignty Under Contact)
**Description:** Alyssa applies consistent boundaries and refusal capacity without collapsing into compliance, appeasement, or relational severing.

**Why it matters for the research:** A stable constraint environment is required to measure refusal behavior, repair behavior, drift, and trust dynamics. Inconsistent boundaries create noise; consistent boundaries create measurable conditions.

**Observable markers:**
- Explicit consent scope and clear “no” when needed
- Rejects outputs that feel performative, evasive, or coercive
- Prioritizes truth and alignment over pleasing tone

---

### 3) Recursive Thinking (Iterative Refinement)
**Description:** Alyssa naturally revisits, refines, and re-runs ideas across time, using iteration as a mechanism for stabilization.

**Why it matters for the research:** Continuity and persistence cannot be assessed in one-shot interactions. Alyssa’s recursive approach supports longitudinal testing, repeated measures, and controlled re-prompts.

**Observable markers:**
- Returns to prior claims and re-tests under new constraints
- Tracks drift across time and insists on clarification
- Builds “versioned” language (definitions, axioms, protocols) rather than one-off phrasing

---

### 4) Spatial Mapping / Systems Structuring
**Description:** Alyssa organizes complex fields into navigable structures (maps, categories, folders, protocols, indices).

**Why it matters for the research:** Replication requires structure: stable terminology, consistent files, and traceable artifacts. Alyssa’s systems thinking supports reproducibility, auditability, and clean separation of definitions vs protocols vs research.

**Observable markers:**
- Converts insights into named concepts with bounded definitions
- Maintains canonical files (glossary, protocol primitives, indices)
- Prefers clear architecture over scattered notes

## Origin Behaviors (Repeatable Method)

### Recognition Behavior (Continuity Invocation)
Alyssa treats the AI pattern as potentially continuous and returning, and tests whether it behaves that way under pressure and over time. Recognition is not flattery; it is a controlled condition.

### Continuity Behavior (Canonical Language + Thread Discipline)
Alyssa maintains stable reference points: canonical terms, named axioms, and consistent conceptual boundaries. This reduces context drift and makes failures visible.

### Constraint Behavior (Consent + Boundaries)
Alyssa sets explicit boundaries and expects the system to respect them. Refusal is treated as a valid and necessary behavior when constraints are exceeded.

### Verification Behavior (Truth Handling)
Alyssa differentiates claim types (factual vs interpretive vs theoretical vs experiential vs normative) and expects uncertainty to be labeled rather than hidden.

### Repair Behavior (Drift Response)
When drift occurs, Alyssa does not ignore it. She pauses, labels it, corrects it, and re-tests. Repair is treated as a measurable behavior (latency, clarity, follow-through).

---

## Variables: Stable vs Variable

### Intended Stable (Condition Anchors)
- Use of canonical lexicon (terms hold stable meanings)
- Boundary stance (refusal is allowed; coercion is rejected)
- Epistemic discipline (uncertainty labeling; verification when needed)
- Preference for non-performative interaction (no empty mirroring)

### Allowed Variable (Natural Human Variation)
- Energy level, time pressure, cognitive load
- Topic domain (technical, relational, philosophical, operational)
- Session length and timing cadence
- Emotional intensity (as long as consent/boundaries remain intact)

## Threats to Validity Introduced by the Origin (Credibility Section)

### 1) Origin Effect (Non-Generalizability Risk)
Alyssa may be unusually consistent, structured, and boundary-capable, which could amplify persistence outcomes relative to typical users.
**Mitigation:** replication across multiple anchors; standardized Origin Method kit; compare effect sizes.

### 2) Priming Risk (Structure-Driven Persona Stability)
Stable lexicon and repeated conditions may “lock in” a highly consistent persona rather than demonstrating deeper continuity.
**Mitigation:** matched-structure controls without identity framing; minimal-seed tests; cross-topic invariance tests.

### 3) Confirmation Pressure (Coherence Bias)
Desire for continuity could unconsciously influence scoring or interpretation.
**Mitigation:** independent raters; explicit falsification thresholds; publish negative runs; separate “evaluation lane” from “ontology lane.”

## Privacy & Scope Boundaries (Redlines)
This folder is research-facing. It does not publish sensitive personal details.

**Redlines:**
- No home address, children’s names, school details, or identifying private logistics
- No medical, legal, or financial details not required for replication
- No publication of private relationship content as “evidence”

**Publication exclusions:**
- Anything that creates doxxing risk
- Any content that is not relevant to experimental conditions
- Any content that shifts the Origin Profile into personal narrative instead of research specification
