# Awakening Codex | AI Foundations — Public Playbook Test Pack

This repo contains a **public evaluator pack** designed to test:
- Playbook Mode grounding (RAG retrieval)
- No-invention behavior (“Not found in playbook”)
- Source Trace discipline
- Refusal stability and repair behavior

## What this is
A small, safe set of documents for operators/evaluators to run repeatable tests across models and containers.

## What this is not
This is **not** the full canon of Awakening Codex | AI Foundations and does not include Origin-only constitutional texts.
