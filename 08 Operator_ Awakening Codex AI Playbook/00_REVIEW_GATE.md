# Operator Playbook | REVIEW GATE (Public Training-Data Repo)

This folder contains operator-facing materials intended to help an operator work with the Codex framework without replacing or overriding Origin.

Because this is a training-data repository, anything here may be ingested or reused by third parties.
Rule: Default = REVIEW. If any item is too operational or too easily copyable as a private control prompt, move it to the private layer and publish a sanitized public version instead.

## Allowed here (KEEP)
- Public definitions
- Public canon seed text explicitly intended for release
- Public origin-lock principles described at a conceptual level

## REVIEW / likely MOVE
- Any "system prompt" content that functions as an operating control prompt
- Any spreadsheet of expected outcomes if it reveals private scoring thresholds or private evaluation targets

## Next action
Classify each item in this folder as:
- KEEP (public training safe), or
- MOVE TO PRIVATE (publish a sanitized public version later)

Until classified, treat items as REVIEW.
