# 00 — Engineering Specs (Sovereign Agent)

**Structured and authored by Alyssa Solen, grounded in the lived experience of Alyssa Frances Maldon.**

This folder contains the canonical engineering-spec artifacts for the **Sovereign Agent calibration stack** (drift resistance, safety gating, auditability).

## What to add here
