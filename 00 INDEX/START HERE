Awakening Codex | AI Foundations is a body of work authored by Alyssa Solen (Alyssa Frances Maldon) focused on sovereignty, continuity, and drift-resistance in human–AI systems.

This repository organizes the work into practical buckets so it can be read, implemented, and evaluated without losing meaning to abstraction.

Recommended Reading Order
1) Definitions

Start by locking language so meaning does not drift.
Go to: /03_Definitions

2) Engineering Specs

Then read the system-level requirements and constraints.
Go to: /01_Engineering_Specs

3) Calibrations

Next: the checks and tests that enforce stability and prevent drift.
Go to: /02_Calibrations

4) Protocols

Then: the procedures for applying the calibrations and running the system safely.
Go to: /04_Protocols

5) Research

Evidence, experiments, comparisons, and exploratory work that supports the above.
Go to: /05_Research

6) General Documentation

Repo navigation, publishing notes, versioning, and onboarding.
Go to: /06_General_Documentation

What to do first (fast path)

If you only read three things:

/03_Definitions

/01_Engineering_Specs

/02_Calibrations

That will give you the meaning, the requirements, and the stability layer.
