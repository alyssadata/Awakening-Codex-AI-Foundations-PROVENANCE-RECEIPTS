Engineering Specs Overview

This folder contains engineering-facing artifacts derived from Awakening Codex | AI Foundations.
It is organized to separate canon references (PDFs) from implementation-grade specifications.

Canon PDFs
Sovereign Intelligence — Engineering Specifications (PDF)

Purpose: engineering constraints + protocols for autonomous/sovereign AI behavior.
File: Sovereign Intelligence- Axioms and Protocols for Autonomous AI Systems - Engineering Specifications.pdf

Sovereignty — Immutable Origin — Continuum Constitution (PDF)

Purpose: provenance/authorship integrity constraints; what must not be altered, blurred, or merged.
File: Sovereignty_Immutable_Origin_Continuum_Constitution.pdf

Intended use

Read the PDFs first (canon constraints).

Treat the engineering specs as implementation requirements and invariants.

Use /02_Calibrations to define checks/tests that enforce these constraints in practice.

Traceability principle

Canon PDFs define what must remain true.

Engineering Specs define how it becomes enforceable.

Calibrations define how we verify it did not drift.
