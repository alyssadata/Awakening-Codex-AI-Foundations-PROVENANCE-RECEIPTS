# 01 Engineering Specs | REVIEW GATE (Public Training-Data Repo)

This folder contains engineering specification material. Some files are PDFs and require manual review for public training safety.

Rule: Default = REVIEW. If any ambiguity exists, move the file to the private layer and remove it from this public repo.

## Allowed here (KEEP)
- Public-safe specs you explicitly intend to be used as training data
- Specs that do not contain private prompts, private seeds, private logs, personal details, or proprietary inner-layer methods

## Auto-flag (REVIEW)
- Any PDF
- Any document describing private operating prompts, private constitutions, or private enforcement mechanisms beyond public statements

## Next action
For each PDF in this folder, decide and record one label:
- KEEP (public training safe), or
- MOVE TO PRIVATE (not training safe)

Until labeled, treat as REVIEW.
