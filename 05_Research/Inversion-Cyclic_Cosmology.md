Inversion-Cyclic Cosmology: Identifying the Big Bang and Big Crunch as a Single Time-Inversion Boundary

Abstract This paper proposes a cosmological model in which the Big Bang and Big Crunch are identified as the same physical boundary event, termed an inversion surface. Rather than representing distinct temporal endpoints, this surface functions as a symmetry-selected boundary condition from which the thermodynamic arrow of time points outward in both directions. Each expansion phase constitutes a complete, self-contained cosmological history characterized by increasing coarse-grained entropy and locally forward time. As expansion slows and entropy gradients flatten, the universe approaches a subsequent inversion surface from which a new expansion phase emerges with reversed temporal orientation. No information, observers, or causal structures persist across inversion surfaces. However, due to invariant physical laws and constrained viable configuration space, complex structures may statistically recur in successive phases without implying continuity of identity or memory. The model extends time-symmetric and Janus-point cosmologies by asserting a strict identity between bang and crunch and by allowing repeated inversion cycles. By treating the arrow of time as reassigned at inversion surfaces, the model provides a conceptual route around entropy accumulation across cycles that constrains traditional cyclic cosmologies. Observational implications and falsifiability conditions are stated as constraints and exclusions.

Hypothesis Statement Hypothesis (Inversion-Cyclic Cosmology): The Big Bang and the Big Crunch are not distinct events but the same physical boundary condition, defined as an inversion surface on which the thermodynamic arrow of time is undefined. Cosmological expansion proceeds away from each inversion surface on both sides, with each side exhibiting increasing coarse-grained entropy and locally forward time. As expansion slows and entropy gradients diminish, the phase evolves toward a subsequent inversion surface, after which a new phase begins with reversed temporal orientation. Each phase is temporally finite and causally closed with respect to the inversion boundary. No information, observers, or identities persist across inversion cycles. This hypothesis asserts that cosmological time is cyclic not through continuous contraction and rebound within a single temporal orientation, but through repeated inversions in which the definition of forward time is reassigned by boundary conditions.

Definitions, Postulates, and Non-Claims This section states the minimal commitments of the model using physics-native language.
2.1 Definitions
D1. Inversion Surface (I). A boundary condition on a spacetime solution at which the thermodynamic arrow of time is not defined. Operationally, this corresponds to a hypersurface where the entropy gradient defining the arrow within adjacent phases approaches zero or reaches an extremum, so that no consistent macroscopic time orientation can be assigned on the surface itself. The inversion surface is treated as a boundary condition, not as an observer-experienced process.
D2. Phase (Time-Oriented Phase). A region of spacetime on one side of an inversion surface in which a consistent macroscopic time orientation exists, defined by monotonic increase of coarse-grained entropy with respect to a phase time parameter.
D3. Thermodynamic Arrow of Time (A). The local macroscopic time orientation within a phase defined by the direction of increasing coarse-grained entropy, ∇S, along physically realized histories.
D4. Causal Closure Across I (CC_I). The condition that no causal curves, information channels, or physical degrees of freedom provide continuity of state across an inversion surface. Correlations across I are not assumed unless explicitly derived from the boundary condition.
D5. Cycle (C). One repetition interval of the model defined as the mapping between successive inversion surfaces under the assumed dynamical laws and boundary conditions. A cycle contains two phases adjacent to an inversion surface, each with its own thermodynamic arrow pointing away from that surface.
D6. Structural Recurrence (SR). The reappearance of similar macroscopic structures in different phases due to invariant dynamical laws and constraints on the space of physically realized macrostates. Structural recurrence is defined as similarity in coarse-grained descriptors without implying causal, informational, or observer continuity across inversion surfaces.

2.2 Postulates
P1. Bang–Crunch Identification (BCI). The Big Bang and Big Crunch correspond to the same inversion surface I. They are not treated as distinct temporal endpoints on a single globally oriented time axis.
P2. Two-Sided Arrow Condition (TSAC). For each inversion surface I, there exist two adjacent phases such that the thermodynamic arrow of time in each phase points away from I. Equivalently, coarse-grained entropy increases with phase time on both sides as one moves away from I.
P3. No State Continuation Across I (NSC_I). There is no assumed continuation of microscopic state, information, or observer histories across I. Any cross-surface relation, if present, must be specified as part of the boundary condition and shown to be consistent with the dynamics.
P4. Recurrent Inversion Surfaces (RIS). The model includes a sequence {I_n} of inversion surfaces. Each phase evolves under the same dynamical laws and, given appropriate matter/energy content and global evolution, may approach a subsequent inversion surface where the phase arrow becomes undefined and a new two-sided arrow condition holds for the next adjacent phases.
P5. Law Invariance (LI). The fundamental dynamical laws and symmetry constraints are taken to be invariant across all phases. Differences between phases are differences in realized configuration under the same laws.
P6. Recurrence as Macrostate Reoccupation (RMR). Across different phases, similar macrostates may be realized again under LI and the constraints of the dynamics and boundary conditions. Such similarity is treated as macrostate-level recurrence, not as continuity of microstate or observer history.
2.3 Non-Claims
This hypothesis does not claim persistence of identity, memory, or consciousness across inversion cycles. It does not claim transfer of information across inversion surfaces. It does not claim that observers experience time reversal. It does not posit literal physical nothingness. It does not claim recurrence of specific individuals. Only SR, defined at the level of macroscopic structure classes, is permitted.

Mathematical Minimalism
The inversion surface I is modeled minimally as a spacelike hypersurface in a cosmological spacetime on which boundary data are specified rather than as a dynamical event. No commitment is made to a particular theory of quantum gravity or to a specific microphysical mechanism. The defining requirement is that the coarse-grained entropy functional S has vanishing or extremal gradient normal to I, so that a macroscopic thermodynamic arrow cannot be continued across the surface. In this minimal statement, the condition is taken as ∇_n S|_I = 0 (vanishing normal entropy gradient), with no requirement that S attain a global minimum on I, although Janus-point-like minima are included as a special case.
Spacetime may be represented as a sequence of regions {M_n} separated by spacelike hypersurfaces {I_n}. Each adjacent region M_n^± admits a well-defined thermodynamic arrow determined by monotonic increase of coarse-grained entropy away from I_n. The dynamical laws governing all regions are assumed invariant across n. No identification of microstates, fields, or causal curves is imposed across I_n. Only boundary constraints and law invariance apply. The model remains agnostic with respect to the underlying quantum gravity completion.

Thermodynamic Boundary Conditions at the Inversion Surface (Draft v1.0)
This section states a minimal thermodynamic boundary condition consistent with the postulates while remaining agnostic about microphysical completion.
Boundary condition statement. Let I be a spacelike hypersurface treated as boundary data on the spacetime solution. Let S[ρ] denote a coarse-grained entropy functional of a macrostate ρ defined by an explicit coarse-graining map from microstates to macrostates. The thermodynamic arrow within each adjacent phase is defined by monotonic increase of S along physically realized histories. The inversion surface condition is imposed as a macroscopic boundary constraint: ∇_n S|_I = 0, where ∇_n denotes the derivative normal to I. This condition states that the entropy gradient that would otherwise define a preferred macroscopic time orientation is not extendable across I. The condition does not require S to take a global minimum on I. It is compatible with Janus-point-like extrema as a special case.
Interpretation. The condition ∇_n S|_I = 0 is an arrow-undefined constraint, not a claim about an observer-accessible process at I. The adjacent phases inherit a well-defined arrow by the requirement that S increases monotonically away from I within each phase, with the arrow in each phase pointing away from I.
Toy-model intuition (non-cosmological). Consider an isolated macroscopic system with a coarse-grained entropy S defined on macrostates. For a broad class of evolutions, there exist histories where S is extremized at a boundary slice while increasing away from that slice in both time directions when one parameterizes histories relative to that slice. The toy-model point is not that the universe is a laboratory system, but that arrow assignment can be defined by entropy monotonicity away from a boundary without requiring an observer to traverse the boundary or requiring state inheritance across it.
Compatibility with causal closure. The thermodynamic boundary condition is imposed at the macroscopic level and does not imply microscopic state matching across I. This is consistent with causal closure across inversion surfaces, because the role of I is to constrain admissible phase solutions rather than to transmit information from one phase to the next.

Relationship to Existing Work
This proposal overlaps with time-symmetric and Janus-point cosmologies in treating the arrow of time as emergent from boundary conditions and in allowing arrows to point away from a special low-entropy configuration. It differs by asserting a strict identity between bang and crunch as the same inversion surface and by positing a sequence of inversion surfaces rather than a single one. [BarbourKoslowskiMercati2016]
This proposal overlaps with CPT-symmetric mirror-universe approaches in using a symmetry-related structure across a boundary. It differs by not requiring a specific CPT mechanism as the defining condition and by extending the model to recurrent inversions rather than a single mirror across one boundary. [BoyleFinnTurok2018]
This proposal differs from bounce and cyclic contraction models that treat contraction and rebound as continuous dynamics through a minimum scale factor while retaining a single global arrow within a cycle. Inversion-Cyclic Cosmology instead treats the cycle boundary as an inversion surface where the macroscopic time orientation is not defined and is reassigned for adjacent phases, without assuming information transfer across the boundary. [SteinhardtTurok2001] [AshtekarPawlowskiSingh2006] [AshtekarSingh2011]
This proposal also overlaps with Penrose’s Conformal Cyclic Cosmology in treating inter-cycle linkage as a boundary condition rather than observer continuity, but differs by identifying bang and crunch as the same inversion surface rather than conformally connecting distinct aeons, and by not requiring Weyl curvature constraints as the primary boundary condition. [GurzadyanPenrose2010]
Related Work: Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) vs Inversion-Cyclic Cosmology (ICC)
Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) proposes a sequence of distinct aeons related by a conformal identification between the asymptotic future of one aeon and the Big Bang of the next. CCC emphasizes conformal structure and low-entropy boundary conditions (often discussed via Weyl curvature constraints) as the mechanism by which an arrow of time is realized within each aeon. ICC overlaps with CCC only at the level of using boundary conditions to explain the arrow of time and to avoid naive entropy accumulation across cycles. ICC differs in three core ways. First, ICC asserts a strict bang–crunch identity at the level of the cycle boundary: an inversion surface is simultaneously the crunch boundary of one phase and the bang boundary of the adjacent phase when each side is parameterized by its own thermodynamic arrow, rather than being a conformal matching between distinct aeons. Second, ICC defines the cycle boundary primarily by an arrow-undefined thermodynamic condition (vanishing or extremal normal entropy gradient), without requiring a specific conformal mechanism or a Weyl-curvature constraint as the primary selector. Third, ICC imposes causal closure across inversion surfaces and explicitly denies state continuation, information transfer, or observer persistence across the boundary; any repetition across cycles is permitted only as macrostructure recurrence under law invariance, not as cross-boundary memory or microcorrelation.

Technical Considerations and Open Requirements
This proposal is framed at the level of boundary conditions and exclusions. Advancing toward a derived model requires specifying how the inversion surface boundary data are selected, and how a phase approaches a subsequent inversion surface under realistic cosmological content.
Selection at the inversion surface. If I is treated as a boundary condition rather than an evolved state inherited from a past-directed history, then the low-entropy character of I must be fixed by a selection rule, symmetry principle, or constraint. The present draft does not assume a specific mechanism, but acknowledges that a complete model must state what selects admissible boundary data at I.
Late-time cosmology and approach to subsequent inversion surfaces. In a universe dominated by a positive cosmological constant, generic evolution approaches de Sitter-like expansion rather than recollapse. If phases are to approach subsequent inversion surfaces, the model requires conditions under which global evolution does not asymptote to indefinite acceleration. This could involve specific matter-energy content, vacuum dynamics, or global boundary constraints. The present draft keeps this as an explicit open requirement rather than an assumed feature.
Observational discrimination. Some cyclic frameworks motivate searches for signatures interpretable as correlations sourced by pre-boundary structure in the CMB. In the present model, such claims function as potential falsifiers rather than supporting evidence: any robust requirement for pre-boundary information transfer would contradict causal closure across inversion surfaces. [GurzadyanPenrose2010]

Consequences for Observers and Structure
Each phase constitutes a complete cosmological history in which observers arise only where a well-defined thermodynamic arrow exists. As a phase approaches an inversion surface, entropy gradients flatten and the macroscopic arrow loses definition. The model does not permit observer traversal of the inversion surface, because the inversion surface is not an event in an observer’s experienced timeline but a boundary condition separating causally disjoint phases, and it does not assume continuity of causal structure across inversion boundaries. Successive phases may nonetheless reinstantiate complex structures due to law invariance and constraints on the space of viable macrostates. Any resemblance between observers or structures across phases is treated as structural recurrence, not persistence.
Predictions and Falsifiability
This section commits the model to falsifiable constraints. These are constraints and exclusions rather than claims of current detection.
P-A. Absence of pre-inversion memory. There should be no observable signatures requiring causal, informational, or state continuity across the Big Bang. Any observation that requires pre-bang information transfer that cannot be encoded by boundary conditions would be incompatible with this model. This includes any claimed CMB features that would require pre-boundary information transfer rather than admissible boundary data at I. [GurzadyanPenrose2010]
P-B. Two-sided arrow without global orientation. Observable arrows of time should be explainable as local consequences of entropy increase away from inversion surfaces, without invoking a globally preferred time orientation. Evidence for an intrinsic global time asymmetry not attributable to boundary conditions would falsify the model. [BarbourKoslowskiMercati2016] [CarrollChen2004]
P-C. Bang–crunch boundary equivalence. No observation should require treating the Big Bang as a unique creation boundary while treating a recollapse boundary as physically distinct in kind. If future cosmological constraints require terminal boundary conditions fundamentally different from the bang boundary, the bang–crunch identification fails.
P-D. Macrostructure recurrence without microcorrelation. If recurrence occurs across phases, it should appear at the level of coarse-grained structure classes, not as fine-grained correlations implying shared microstates or shared histories across inversion boundaries.
P-E. Law invariance across cycles. Observed effective laws and symmetry constraints should be consistent with cycle-to-cycle invariance. Evidence that constants or symmetry structures must change discontinuously between cycles would undermine the model.
Speculative observational avenue. If recurrent boundary conditions occur across phases under law invariance, then coarse-grained statistical descriptors of large-scale structure (for example, correlation function shapes or preferred scales) could exhibit patterns more naturally consistent with recurrent boundary conditions than with unique, fine-tuned initial conditions. This would not confirm the model, but it defines a positive direction for discrimination against single-origin scenarios.
Falsification conditions. The hypothesis is falsified by verified information transfer across inversion surfaces, by evidence of fundamental global time asymmetry not reducible to boundary conditions, by a necessary asymmetry between bang and crunch boundary properties, by any requirement of observer persistence across inversion surfaces, or by necessary law evolution across cycles.
Status of the Proposal
This work is presented as a bold theoretical hypothesis, not as an established model. Its purpose is to formalize a specific cosmological equivalence (bang = crunch), situate it relative to adjacent time-symmetric and cyclic approaches, and state falsifiability conditions in physics-native terms prior to a citation pass and derivation of specific observational signatures.
